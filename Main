# Notes

## Commands? What?
There's many commands, and most are straightforward to use. Hopefully, having everything here where you can scroll through at your leisure will make things seem a little less scary.

| Key | Info |
|:---:|:-----|
| **Prefix** | Commands can be prefixed with `!` or `?` |
| **Aliases** | `![command\|alias]` |
| \<argument\> | This means the argument is __**required**__. |
| [argument=100] | This means the argument is __**optional**__, and the default value is **100**. |
| [A\|B] | This means that it can be __**either A or B**__. |
| [argument...] | This means you can have multiple arguments. |

For example:

The `help` command has an alias `halp`, so `!help`, `?help`, `!halp`, `?halp` will all pull up the same help command.

Now that you know the basics, it should be noted that...
__**You do not type in the brackets!**__

## Pinning
We have a pin system in Darigan Citadel that lets you advertise what you're buying/selling in ***#trading***, and UFT/UFA pets in ***#poundchat*** + ***#customization***.

| Input | Info |
|:-----:|:-----|
| `!pin` command | Allows you to pin the message. |
| Self-react with 📌 | ^ Ditto. |

After 24h, or if you pin another message, your previous pinned message will be taken down.

# Food Club System

## Info
- BetterNeo has a system based upon "subscribing" to your bet set. This allows each member to keep track of their FC bets, and keep records!
- BetterNeo can even make bets tailored for your max bet amount, called `max TER` (or `Maximum Total Expected Return`).
  - Basically it's the most mathematically profitable set for your bet amount, while still being likely to win.
- BetterNeo's bet system uses *only* https://neofood.club/ + https://foodclub.neocities.org/ -compatible bet URLs. (sometimes referred to as "NFC URLs")
- Sending a compatible bet URL will have BetterNeo show an embed with the bet's details, chances of winning etc.
  - Clicking the <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/406939315872989184.png" height="32" width="32"> reaction provided will subscribe you to that set for the round.
    - Another way to subscribe is using the `!bet [foodcluburl]` command.
    - *Since results will be posted there...* Subscribing is only possible if you are in the Darigan Citadel server.
- You may only subscribe to one set per round.
  - Subscribing to one and then another will replace your first one.
- If your subscribed bet wins, you will be pinged in ***#foodclub*** in the Darigan Citadel server when the round ends.
  - If you bust, you'll only be pinged if you have the `Food Club Busters` role.
  - If you'd like to be reminded to bet at 3 PM NST, you may want the `Food Club Remindee` role.
  - See [Subscribable Roles](#subscribable-roles) for more info on those.
- For more in-depth Food Club info, please refer to the pins in ***#foodclub*** in the Darigan Citadel server!

## Food Club Commands
These commands are powerful + modular in the sense that you can now prefix some of them (please note the "Aliases" column) with any of `g`, `r`, or `o`, for General (generated with bet amount not being in the equation) sets, Reverse (sorted from worst to best) sets, and Opening-odds (will use opening odds instead of current odds to make the set), respectively.

You can mix and match, assuming the aliases are listed. `!orgmer` for example will give you MER with reverse general bets that use opening odds, and so on. If they're listed below, it's possible.

| Command | Aliases | Info |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-----|
| `!arenas [round_number=0]` | *none* | Displays the current round (or round of your choosing)'s arena stats. |
| `!bet [foodcluburl]` | *none* | Manually subscribes you to be tagged if the bet URL you submit wins! Any of the bet-making commands, or posting a bet URL alone will allow you to do this with a reaction. Sending this command with no URL shows your current subscribed bet. |
| `!bet random [query]` | `r` | Makes a randomized set from your 100 best bets. *(Based on net expected!)* |
| `!bet unsub` | *none* | Unsubscribe from your current bet. |
| `!betsim [arguments]` | *none* | An advanced command to simulate previous food club rounds, using bets tweaked with settings you choose.<br>This command uses a powerful "command line" syntax.<br><br>The following options are valid.<br>`--maxbet <amount>`: Sets the max bet for the simulator. *Default 8,000. Max 500,000. Min 50.*<br>`--units <amount>`: Sets the ?units amount for the simulator. *Default 20. Max 371,293. (Highest possible, 13^5)*<br>`--rounds <amount>`: Sets the amount of previous rounds to simulate, starting from yesterdays.<br>`--from <bet_round>`: Simulator will start calculating from this round.<br>`--to <bet_round>`: If `--from` is set, this will be the round the simulator stops at (inclusive). This does not work without `--from`. Defaults to current round.<br><br>Flag options (no arguments):<br>`--tenbet`: Simulator will only do tenbets for each pirate instead of anything else.<br>`--all`: Simulator includes all combinations of ?mer.<br>`--debug`: Show benchmarking stats for the simulation data.<br>`--nochart`: Hide the large table of data, and only show the image.<br>`--month`: Simulator will only calculate rounds from this month.<br>`--year`: Simulator will only calculate rounds from this calendar year.<br><br>NOTES:<br>You cannot mix and match the flags that change the amount of rounds that will be calculated. |
| `!bustproof [query]` | `bp` | Generates bust-proof bets for the current FC round, given there are any positive arenas. Be sure to follow the amounts given in the URL! |
| `!compare <pirate1> <pirate2>` | *none* | Compares two pirates' win rate when they're playing the same arena. |
| `!crazy [max_bet] [query]` | *none* | Makes a set that has 5 pirates in each bet. Crazy? Yes. Unlikely? Also yes. |
| `!fcage <amount>` | *none* | Shows the account age required for a specific FC max bet amount. |
| `!fcdata` | *none* | Sends a spreadsheet-importable file to you of your previous subscribed Food Club bets. |
| `!fcspreadsheet` | *none* | Generates 5 spreadsheet-importable CSV files in a .zip of previous Food Club round data. Feel free to make fancy graphs or something with this data!<br><br>The files included are:<br>- arenas.csv for arena data (S=Shipwreck, L=Lagoon, T=Treasure Island, C=Hidden Cove, H=Harpoon Harry’s)<br>- fas.csv for FA (food adjustment) data<br>- opening_odds.csv for opening odds data<br>- closing_odds.csv for closing odds data<br>- results.csv for win/loss (1 for win, 0 for loss) data. Note that early FA data was not available and is left to say None. |
| `!fcstats` | *none* | Shows win percentage of all pirates. |
| `!foodclub [member]` | `fc` | Shows statistics of the Food Club Subscriptions of the server as a whole, or a member. Only counts previous rounds. |
| `!foodclub leaderboard` | `lb` | Shows the leaderboard for subscribed bets. *Must have bet 30+ times, and have to have done a bet in the last 30 days to be eligible for calculation.* |
| `!gambit [pirates...] [max_bet] [query]` | `ogambit`, `rgambit` | Generates a gambit set for the current round. It's basically a set utilizing the top pirate from each arena ***UNLESS*** you pass five pirate names (order doesn't matter). |

| `!giverounds` | *none* | Gives you the JSON files of the Food Club rounds in a zip file. |
| `!maxbet <amount>` | `mb` | Sets your internal bet amount to \<amount\> NP. The bet-making commands will use this number by default. Override this by passing a [max_bet] parameter to those commands otherwise. Amount must be an even number between 50 and 500,000 inclusive. Set to 0 to un-set. Best to set this *before* a round ends, as it increments *after* each round. |
| `!maxter [max_bet] [query]` | `mer`, `gmer`, `omer`, `rmer` | Generates the top 10 max TER bets for the current FC round. (Override your darigancitadel-held max_bet from `!maxbet` in this command by using `!gmer` for general bets or by setting an amount) |
| `!tenbet <pirates...> [max_bet]` | `gtenbet`, `otenbet`, `rtenbet` | Makes a ten-bet set of up to three pirates. First names only, and some nicknames will work. |
| `!tenbet random [query]` | `r` | Generates a random tenbet set for the current round. |
| `!units <units> [max_bet] [query]` | `ounits` | Makes a set which is most likely to hit *at least* the amount of units you enter. |
| `!wgambit [round_number]` | *none* | Shows the best winning gambit for a given previous round. I know you're curious so the best round so far is 6255. |
| `!ybet [round_number]` | *none* | Shows your subscribed bet for a previous round. |



### Food Club Command Queries
All of the bet commands that have a `[query]` parameter are flexible. The possibilities are powerful, and a bit intermediate in terms of difficulty, but some people will find this all very useful. Resulting bets will be annotated with successful changes, if any occurred. The examples below will be using ?mer, but again these will work with other commands as well.

| Query Usage | Description |
|:-----------:|:------------|
| `?mer goob 3 dan 5` | This changes the odds for Goob to be 3, and for Dan to be 5.<br>*You can do all the pirates if you wanted.*<br>This usually drastically changes bets, *so if you need it you'd know*. |
| `?mer --round 6969` | The usage example will output the MER bet using the closing odds of round 6969. |
| `?mer --round -1` | A shorthand way to generate MER for the previous round.<br>You can do `-2` for the day before that, and so on. |
| `?mer --time 4PM` | The usage example will output the current round's MER output for 4PM.<br><br>At the time of writing, that's about 20 minutes after the round started.<br><br>This is for when you want odds from a specific time of the day to calculate a bet set.<br><br>This has minute precision, so you can do `?mer --time 4:20PM`.<br><br>***Time is in NST, and AM/PM is required!*** |
| `?mer --round -1 --time 12PM` | This will give you yesterday's MER using the odds from Noon NST. |
